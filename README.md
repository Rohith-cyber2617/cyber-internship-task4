# Cyber Internship - Task 4  
**Title:** Firewall Rule Implementation and Testing  
**Intern Name:** Rachapudi Rohith (Tony)  
**Task Objective:** Configure firewall rules to block a specific port (Telnet - Port 23) and verify its effectiveness.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Task Overview**  
This task demonstrates how to:
1. Enable a Telnet service on the system.
2. Connect to it locally.
3. Block the connection using a Windows firewall rule.
4. Verify that the firewall rule is working.

## **ðŸ›  Tools Used**
- **Windows 10 VM** (inside VMware)
- **Windows Defender Firewall**
- **Telnet Client & Telnet Server** (Windows Features)

Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed


---

### **Conclusion**
This experiment confirmed that Windows Firewall rules can effectively:
- Block access to a specific service by port number.
- Restrict connections both locally and remotely.

**Security Relevance:**  
- Blocking unused or vulnerable ports reduces the attack surface.
- Helps prevent unauthorized access to legacy services like Telnet.


---

## **âœ… Conclusion**
The test successfully showed that the firewall rule effectively blocked port 23, preventing Telnet access. This validates that firewall configurations can control network access to services.
